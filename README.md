## Assignment 1

## Introduction
The total 7 questions' results in report were got all from:
1. "checkpoints.ipynb"
2. "SVM.py" and "my_svm.py"
3. "CNN.py"
4. "transfer.py"
5. "CAM.ipynb"

## Other data files
1. The dataset file path is "./cifar-10-python/cifar-10-batches-py"
2. The other data file--"train_feat_my.npy","train_feat_in.npy","test_feat_my.npy","test_feat_in.npy" were the hog features extracted by "checkpoints.ipynb"
3. The model file---"mymodel.pth" was saved by "CNN.py" and "trans_alex.pth" was saved by "transfer.py"
